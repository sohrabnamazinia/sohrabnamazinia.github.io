### Sohrab Namazi Nia â€“ AI Enthusiast!

Hey there! I'm **Sohrab Namazi Nia**, a **PhD candidate in Computer Science** at **New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT)**. I work as a Research Assistant in **Big Data Analytics Laboratory (BDAL)**, where my primary focus is applying **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to data science applications, including **recommendation systems**, **ranking algorithms**, and more. My interests also extend into **reinforcement learning**, **deep learning**, and optimizing **graph search algorithms** for efficiency.

I earned my **Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering** from **Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST)** in 2018. Located in Tehran, IUST is ranked among the top-4 universities in Iran, and my time there was filled with both great personal and collaborative projects centered on **AI**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Deep Learning (DL)**, **algorithm design**. I also ventured into **backend development** as part of my work in **software engineering**. I was honored to be named the **Top Student of the Year in 2019**, and graduated with a **GPA of 4.0**.

### Beyond Academia - Spencer!

While Sohrab is my formal name, I'm known as **Spencer** among friends. Outside of my academic pursuits, **astronomy** and **space science** are huge passions of mine. I closely follow space exploration news, and one of my biggest dreams is to apply my AI expertise to space applications. As Stephen Hawking once said, *"Humanity's future survival and exploration lie in venturing beyond Earth and into the cosmos."* I aspire to contribute to that future in some way. Also, I want to mention that before turning 18, I had a deep interest in philosophy and followed it closely, but eventually, my focus shifted away from it.
 
On a different note, **football (soccer)** has always been a big part of my life. I played competitively until the age of 18 and still enjoy playing casually today. **Football** has always remained one of my greatest passions in life. I also like swimming!
